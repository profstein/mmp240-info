## Intro

<p>For this assignment you will start to create wireframes for Project 3. In this project we will build off of project 2 NYC Landmarks. We will add some more landmarks so there will be 9 total landmarks. We will also add a page for each landmark. For this part of the process you will plan out the layout of the home page and how the landmark pages will look using Wireframes.</p>


## Wireframes

<p>What are frames are important part of the web design process and they are a chance for us to think through the content and layout of our pages before we actually start writing HTML and CSS. The basic idea behind wire frames is to provide a visualization of how the page will look. Ideally wire frames don't take that much time so you can quickly visualize and also change them if need be.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will hear of a couple types of wire frames one type being low fidelity or lo-fi wire frames and another being high fidelity or hi-fi.</p>
<h3><strong>Lo-Fi vs Hi-Fi Wireframes</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Low-fidelity (Lo-Fi) wireframes</strong> are quick, simplified sketches of a web page or app layout. They focus on <strong>structure, hierarchy, and user flow</strong> — not on visuals. Think of them as “blueprints” showing where things go (like navigation, content blocks, buttons) without worrying about color, font, or detailed alignment. They don't have final text and sometime just use solid blocks to represent text. They’re fast to make and easy to change, which makes them ideal for early-stage planning, brainstorming, and feedback.</p>
<p><strong>High-fidelity (Hi-Fi) wireframes</strong>, on the other hand, are more detailed and often created digitally (e.g., in Figma).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mockups are a realistic rendering of what the site will look like. They include <strong>typography, color, spacing, and often interactivity</strong> to simulate the real user experience. These are typically used later in the design process to refine visual design and prepare for development.</p>

<p><strong>In this course</strong>, we’ll focus on<strong>&nbsp;wireframes</strong> that are more lo-fi and use pre-built interface elements during project planning so we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Concentrate on content organization and usability before getting distracted by style.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quickly test ideas and get peer/instructor feedback.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>👉 <em>Think of Lo-Fi wireframes as the “blueprint” for your design; Hi-Fi wireframes are the “rendering.”</em></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><em>Note that we don't need 9 sets of wireframes for the landmark pages because they all have the same structure and we re doing lo-fi wireframes.</em></strong></span><span style="font-size: 20px;"><strong><em></em></strong></span></p>


## Creating the Wireframes

<p>For this phase of the project, we're going to make both desktop and mobile wire frames for the homepage and a landmark page.</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>Here is the content that's needed for each page.</p>
<h4><strong>Homepage content requirements</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Header with site title and Navigation</li>
<li>Introduction - 2 paragraphs</li>
<li>Landmarks Video</li>
<li>Featured Landmark (image, title, description) - optional you can havemore than one featuerd landmark</li>
<li>Grid showing all 9 landmarks (image w/credit, name of landmark)</li>
<li>Footer&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Landmark Pages Content Requirements</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Header with site title and Navigation</li>
<li>Title: Name of Landmark</li>
<li>Image(s) of Landmark</li>
<li>Description of Landmark</li>
<li>Next and Previous links to other landmark pages</li>
<li>Footer</li>
</ul>
<p>I will be giving you the content, your job is to put it on web pages.</p>
<h2>To create the wireframes</h2>
<h3>Video Walkthrough</h3>
<p><iframe src="/d2l/wcs/mp/mediaplayer.d2l?ou=6606&amp;entryId=e36a7cb7-a52c-4d1d-a2fa-2a5dbef7a3c8&amp;captionsEdit=False" title="Making Wireframes in Figma" width="100%" height="450px" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" style="max-width: 800px;"></iframe></p>
<p>Watch the video for the most detailed explanation of how to work with the page content templates that are in the file. The process is outlined below in text as well.</p>
<ol>
<li>Take a minute to think about how you will arrange the content on each page. I recommend drawing with pencil and paper.</li>
<li>Download the NYC-Landmark-Wireframes.fig file</li>
<li>Go to the Website Wireframes page</li>
<li>Add a Header to both the desktop and mobile frames
<ol>
<li>You can do this by either going into assets and looking for header or by copying from the Headers and footers page.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Repeat this for the other content on the page, ending with the footer.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do things out of order, you can drag and drop to reorder them.</p>
<p>When you are done Save a Local Copy of your figma file and submit this by Sunday.</p>
