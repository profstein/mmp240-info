        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>Netlify is a platform that helps to host and deploy applications. We will use it in our class to host our websites. When you use a GitHub repository like we do, the connection is pretty simple. Also, for our uses it's free.</p>

        <h2>Working with Netlify</h2>
        <h3>Creating a Netlify Project</h3>
        <p>This is the name for a web site. We will create one that is tied to your GitHub repository. You will use your GitHub account to sign in to Netlify. The video below walks you through the process</p>

        </div>
        <h3>Deployment After GitHub Update</h3>
        <p>Every time you push changes (also part of Sync from in VS Code) to GitHub main branch, your Netlify project will deploy (update it's files too). Here is a video walkthrough.</p>

      <section id="concepts">
        <h2>Concepts</h2>
        <h3>Project</h3>
        <p>These are the web sites you make on Netlify.</p>
        <h3>Deployment</h3>
        <p>This refers to when Netlify creates a new version if your site</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>One thing to keep in mind is that a new deployment only happens when you push your changes to the main branch of GitHub. So there are a few things you can do to limit how many times you push changes to the main branch:</p>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li>Don't sync often to GitHub</li>
          <li>Use a branching workflow and make your changes on a different branch, even push those other branches to GitHub. Then only when you know everything is ready, merge the changes to the main branch and push that to GitHub.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Credits</h3>
        <p>This is how Netlify keeps track of how much you use it and sees if you've gone over the free limit.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Production deploys (changes to main branch trigger it): 15 credits</li>
          <li>Web requests (when anyone views one of your pages): 3 credits for 10,000 requests.</li>
          <li>Bandwidth (amount of data used, includes file size of images, media and html pages): 10 credits for 1 GB</li>
        </ul>
         <p>For more on credits and pricing, see the <a href="https://www.netlify.com/pricing/">Netlify Pricing Page</a>.</p>
         <h3>Build</h3>
         <p>When Netlify reads the data from your GitHub repository and makes your site ready on the web it's called a build. Each time you push changes to your <b>main</b> branch on GitHub, Netlify will <b>build your site.</b></p>
         <h4>For Future Reference</h4>
         <p>When making dynamic web sites you don't just write the HTML/CSS and individual pages. There is a system that <strong>builds</strong> your site out of parts. Sometimes this is from data in a database, sometimes its from markdown or other static files.</p>
         <p>We will not make this kind of site in our class. It's the next level of web site and how most large, professional sites are made. Netlify supports the build process (something that you can't quite do with GitHub pages at the moment).</p>
