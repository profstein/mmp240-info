# Week 9: 10/21–10/26

## Intro
This week we get started on Project 3. We are not doing a lot of coding; the focus is more on getting you set up for that and introducing some new things. Follow along in this order:

## Week Activities

1. [RWD Intro](/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou={orgUnitId}&type=content&rcode=553F80D6-3EB2-4A0C-B321-7D8FDFC0E4FA-8098510): RWD stands for Responsive Web Design
	1. [RWD Resources](/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou={orgUnitId}&type=content&rcode=553F80D6-3EB2-4A0C-B321-7D8FDFC0E4FA-8098512) (optional)
	2. This is big-picture information. We will do more to implement RWD next week.

2. [Project 3 Wireframes Start](/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou={orgUnitId}&type=content&rcode=553F80D6-3EB2-4A0C-B321-7D8FDFC0E4FA-8098640)
	1. [Creating the Wireframes](/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou={orgUnitId}&type=content&rcode=553F80D6-3EB2-4A0C-B321-7D8FDFC0E4FA-8098642) — this has the video that walks you through
	2. You will be submitting your wireframes at the end of the week.

3. [Copilot Setup to use AI in VS Code](/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou={orgUnitId}&type=content&rcode=553F80D6-3EB2-4A0C-B321-7D8FDFC0E4FA-8098513)
	1. I'm not requiring you to submit this, but you should follow along as it will help you with what you need to do for the project later.

4. [Branching in Git and GitHub](/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou={orgUnitId}&type=content&rcode=553F80D6-3EB2-4A0C-B321-7D8FDFC0E4FA-8098514)
	1. I'm not requiring you to submit this, but you should follow along as it will help you with what you need to do for the project later.

5. [Example: Combining AI and Branching](/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou={orgUnitId}&type=content&rcode=553F80D6-3EB2-4A0C-B321-7D8FDFC0E4FA-8098515) — this shows you the work in action.
	1. This can also help you with Project 2 if you're not done with that yet.
